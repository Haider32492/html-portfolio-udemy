The film received largely negative reviews from critics, with criticism for its plot, action sequences, Stallone's limited screen time, Waugh's direction, absence of most of the original cast and visual effects. It has grossed $51 million worldwide against a budget of $100 million which made it a box office bomb</p>
    <h3>Fast & Furious</h3>
    <p>Fast & Furious (also known as The Fast and the Furious) is an American media franchise centered on a series of action films that are largely concerned with street racing, heists, spies, and family.

        The first film, based on the 1998 Vibe magazine article "Racer X" by Ken Li and written by Gary Scott Thompson, Erik Bergquist, and David Ayer, was released in 2001.

The series transitioned towards heists and spying with Fast Five (2011), which was followed by five sequels in that genre, the most recent of which, Fast X, was released on May 19, 2023.</p>
